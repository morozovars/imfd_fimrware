@par Application Description

This application exploits OpenBootloader Middleware to demonstrate how to develop an IAP application
and how use it.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK)
to run at 40 MHz.

Then, these protocols and memories interfaces are configured
  - USART1
  - FDCAN1
  - FLASH interface
  - RAM interface
  - Option bytes interface

Then, the OpenBootloader application will wait for incoming communication on one of the supported protocols.

Once a communication is established through one of the supported protocols,
the OpenBootloader application will wait for commands sent by the host.

@note In case of Mass Erase operation, the OpenBootloader FLASH area must be protected otherwise the OpenBootloader
      will be erased.

@par Keywords

OpenBootloader, USART, FDCAN

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32G474QETx devices.

  - This example has been tested with a STM32G474E-EVAL Rev B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32G474E-EVAL set-up to use FDCAN1:
    - Jumper JP1 => fitted
    - Jumper JP4 => fitted
    - Connect the 2 points CN12 CAN connector (CAN-H and CAN-L) of FDCAN1
      instance to your FDCAN Host adapter

  - STM32G474E-EVAL set-up to use USART:
    - To use the USART1 for communication you have to connect:
      - Tx pin of your host adapter to PA10 pin of the STM32G474E-EVAL board
      - Rx pin of your host adapter to PA9 pin of the STM32G474E-EVAL board

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
  - Run STM32CubeProgrammer and connect to OpenBootloader using USART1
    Or
  - Connect your FDCAN host adapter and connect to OpenBootloader using FDCAN1

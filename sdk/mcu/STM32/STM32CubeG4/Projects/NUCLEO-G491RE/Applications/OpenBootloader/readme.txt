@par Application Description

This application exploits OpenBootloader Middleware to demonstrate how to develop an IAP application
and how use it.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK)
to run at 72 MHz.

Then, these protocols and memories interfaces are configured
  - USART1
  - I2C2
  - FLASH interface
  - RAM interface
  - Option bytes interface

Then, the OpenBootloader application will wait for incoming communication on one of the supported protocols.

Once a communication is established through one of the supported protocols,
the OpenBootloader application will wait for commands sent by the host.

@note In case of Mass Erase operation, the OpenBootloader FLASH area must be protected otherwise the OpenBootloader
      will be erased.

@par Keywords

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32G491RE devices.

  - This example has been tested with a NUCLEO-G491RE board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-G491RE set-up to use I2C:
    - To use the I2C2 for communication you have to connect:
      - SCL pin of your host adapter to PC4 pin (Arduino connector CN9 pin D1, Morpho connector CN10 pin 35) of the NUCLEO-G491RE board
      - SDA pin of your host adapter to PA8 pin (Arduino connector CN9 pin D7, Morpho connector CN10 pin 23) of the NUCLEO-G491RE board

  - NUCLEO-G491RE set-up to use USART:
    - To use the USART1 for communication you have to connect:
      - Tx pin of your host adapter to PA10 pin (Arduino connector CN9 pin D2, Morpho connector CN10 pin 33) of the NUCLEO-G491RE board
      - Rx pin of your host adapter to PA9 pin (Arduino connector CN5 pin D8, Morpho connector CN10 pin 21) of the NUCLEO-G491RE board

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
  - Run STM32CubeProgrammer and connect to OpenBootloader using USART1
    Or
  - Run STM32CubeProgrammer and connect to OpenBootloader through STLINK V3 using I2C2
